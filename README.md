# robotArm

a fun project based on the HowToMechatronics's robot arm.

I replaced the HC05 and smartphone pilot by an android Things kit made by google.
For this version of the app, there are 6 sliders on the screen, each driving a servo of the arm.

This need to be improved, as this is the first android and android Things app I'm doing, but i think this is a good start.
